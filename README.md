Trackify - A Personal Productivity App
Trackify is a Java-based desktop application built with JavaFX and MySQL, designed to help users manage their tasks and notes efficiently. It features user authentication, a modern graphical user interface with sidebar navigation, and user-specific data storage to ensure privacy and personalization.
Features

User Authentication:
Register with a username, email, and password.
Log in to access personal tasks and notes.
Passwords are stored in plain text (for development; not recommended for production).


Task Management:
Add, edit, and delete tasks with details such as due date, priority (A, B, C, D), and category (Work, Personal, Study, Home, Other).
Task cards display a preview (first 50 characters); full details (task text, due date, priority, category, completed status) are shown in an edit dialog.
Mark tasks as completed, with visual strikethrough on cards.


Notes Management:
Create, edit, and delete rich-text notes using an HTML editor.
Notes are displayed in a grid with a preview (first 100 characters).
Edit or delete notes by clicking on their cards.


User-Specific Data:
Tasks and notes are tied to the logged-in userâ€™s UserID, ensuring data isolation between users.


Modern GUI:
Consistent 1300x700 pixel windows with a light gray background (#f1f5f9) and white cards for content.
Sidebar navigation for switching between Tasks and Notes, with a logout option.
Logo and "Trackify" title displayed in the header of all windows (Intro, Login, Register, Main Dashboard).
Professional styling with shadows, rounded corners, cyan buttons (#00acc1), and hover effects for interactivity.



Technologies Used

Java 23: Core programming language.
JavaFX: For the graphical user interface.
MySQL: Database for storing users, tasks, and notes.
MySQL Connector/J: JDBC driver for database connectivity.

Setup Instructions

Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) 23.
JavaFX SDK.
MySQL Server.
IntelliJ IDEA.


Steps

Clone or Download the Repository:

If using Git:
git clone https://github.com/muhammadyasirm/trackify.git
cd trackify


Alternatively, download the ZIP file from GitHub and extract it.



Set Up MySQL Database:

Start MySQL Server.

Create a database named todoapp:
CREATE DATABASE todoapp;


Run the schema.sql file to create tables:
USE todoapp;
CREATE TABLE users (
    UserID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    Username VARCHAR(50),
    Email VARCHAR(100),
    Password VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE notes (
    Notes_ID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    user_ID INT,
    Notes LONGTEXT,
    lastModified TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_ID) REFERENCES users(UserID)
);

CREATE TABLE tasks (
    task_ID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    task VARCHAR(10000),
    dueDate DATE,
    dueTime TIME,
    priority VARCHAR(50),
    category VARCHAR(100),
    completed BOOLEAN,
    user_ID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_ID) REFERENCES users(UserID)
);


Ensure MySQL credentials match those in DBconnection.java or replace these with your own:
private static final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/todoapp?useSSL=false";
private static final String USERNAME = "root";
private static final String PASSWORD = "yasir";




Configure JavaFX:

Download and install the JavaFX SDK from openjfx.io.
In IntelliJ IDEA:
Go to File > Project Structure > Libraries, add the JavaFX SDK lib folder.

In the run configuration for Main.java, add VM options:
--module-path "/path/to/javafx-sdk/lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.web --add-exports javafx.controls/com.sun.javafx.scene.control=ALL-UNNAMED 

Replace /path/to/javafx-sdk/lib with the actual path to the JavaFX SDK.


Add MySQL Connector:

The mysql-connector-java-8.0.33.jar is included in the lib/ folder.
In IntelliJ IDEA:
Go to File > Project Structure > Modules > Dependencies.
Click "+" > JARs or Directories, select Trackify/lib/mysql-connector-java-8.0.33.jar, and click OK.
Ensure Export is checked.




Run the Application:

Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
Build the project (Build > Rebuild Project).
Run Main.java (select it and press Shift+F10).



Usage

Intro Screen:
Displays the Trackify logo and title for 3 seconds, then transitions to the login screen.


Login/Register:
Register a new user with a username, email, and password.
Log in using your credentials to access the main dashboard.


Main Dashboard:
Use the sidebar to navigate between Tasks and Notes.
Tasks:
Add tasks with a description, due date, priority, and category via the input area at the bottom.
View task previews on cards; click Edit to modify details (task text, due date, priority, category, completed status) or Delete to remove.


Notes:
Add rich-text notes using the HTML editor.
View note previews in a grid; click a card to edit or delete.


Logout: Return to the login screen.


Data Privacy:
Each user sees only their own tasks and notes, based on their UserID.


Security Note
Passwords are stored in plain text for development simplicity. For production, use a secure hashing library like jBCrypt.
Update DBconnection.java with secure MySQL credentials.
